 MSU Data Analytics BootCamp Module 9 Challenge

Code file names: challenge9schemata.sql, challenge9datacollection.sql

These PostgreSQL SQL files perform the following functions:

Create several data tables within a SQL database to store data relating to employees and their employment information. Then the user can import CSV files located in a directory called 'data' to load each table with relevant data, after which a seperate SQL file peforms a series of database calls to collect and summarize specific employee data. Also included in the repository is an entity relationship diagram of the tables within the database.

*Code sourcing statement*
-----------------------

I did use a natural language description of the desired code's functions entered into ChatGPT 3.5 to help with code syntax. I did copy pieces of that code in order to be more efficient, but I tailored it to fit all of the desired functions of this paricular project. I did not directly copy and paste any of this code from the internet otherwise (e.g., from StackExchange or any other webpage). I did not seek any assistance or use code written by my peers or instructors for this challenge.

End of code sourcing statement.
